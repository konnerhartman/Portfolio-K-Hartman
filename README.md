# K. Hartman Portfolio (React)
  ![License Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg)    

  ## Description
  This is my latest version of my portfolio. 
  My motivation to build this portfolio was to have presentable documentation for potential employers and colleagues.
  I built this app using the MERN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, React, NodeJS). I also used other technologies (NPM, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, Bootstrap, EmailJS, Font Awesome, Google Fonts) to complete this.
